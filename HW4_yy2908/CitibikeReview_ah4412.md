## a. Verify that their null and alternative hypotheses are formulated correctly
### Verification:
There do not appear to be an idea and hypotheses set up.  
### Suggestions: 
Based on the data selected, an idea might be to examine if younger riders take more trips on weekends. Next, we would need a set of testable hypotheses and an alpha level.  

**NULL:** For weekend trips, the proportion of trips taken by riders born after 1990 is the same or smaller than the proportion of trips taken by riders born in or before 1990.  
$$p_{younger} \leq p_{older}$$
\newline
**ALT:** For weekend trips, the proportion of trips taken by riders born after 1990 is greater than the proportion of trips taken by riders born in or before 1990.  
$$p_{younger} > p_{older}$$
